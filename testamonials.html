    <p><strong>"Knowledgeable, patient and fun"</strong>
- Carina Chicago, IL on 3/31/2017<br>
Paul is definitely serious about teaching the right technique from the start. Detailed oriented, dedicated, motivating and empathetic. I went to my first class afraid of not having what it takes to learn. I came out of the class feeling capable, excited and looking forward to practice and the next lesson.

<strong>"Great tutor"</strong>- Chris Chicago, IL on 1/9/2017<br>
I am a mature age guitar learner and I have just started with Paul. He is very knowledgeable, great to work with and I feel he can definitely help me become proficient on the guitar!

<strong>"Patient, flexible and extremely knowledgeable."</strong>
- Timothy Chicago, IL on 3/11/2016<br>
I have been "playing" guitar for 10 years but never actually learned the guitar. Paul was able to quickly discern what I already knew and what I needed to work on to get where I wanted to be. His lessons have been flexible, both in content and scheduling. Every time we have a session, I feel excited I've learned something new and confident that I'm on the right path. Musicians of any level would benefit from lessons with Paul!

<strong>"Another valuable session"</strong>
- Alida Chicago, IL on 2/21/2016<br>
We went over last week's assignments, including the chromatic scale, C Major Scale, C Major chords, and strumming. We added on variations on the chromatic scale, with an emphasis on playing the original faster and more precisely. I am still struggling with hammer-on's, but Paul was very supportive. We're finally getting through the strum pattern on the song I started with – Fake Plastic Trees – and I'm realizing how much easier it is to play all the way through after we've been working on individual components of my technique.

<strong>"Patient, Thoughtful, Intelligent Teacher"</strong>
- Theresa Chicago, IL on 8/10/2015<br>
I recommend Paul to anyone with an eagerness to learn anything about music. He responds quickly and professionally and is prompt come lesson time. He was also flexible in scheduling our first lesson. I particularly appreciated his inquisitive approach when I didn't understanding something. He remained focused and on task since I frequently would go off topic. Music Theory is extremely complicated to learn, yet Paul finally helped me turn the complex into something I can finally understand.
